# Slim Canis

I built this framework a long time ago, it is now abandoned... y strongly recommend to go ahead an use [Slim PHP](https://www.slimframework.com/) for any API development with PHP.

I would also install the [Eloquent ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/5.0/eloquent) on top of Slim, together they are a spectacular tool for API creation, [here is how.](https://www.slimframework.com/docs/cookbook/database-eloquent.html)
